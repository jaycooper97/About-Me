<p>I was born as Ja'vonne Caprice Cooper, but obviously Jay is way shorter and cooler.  My entire family is from Trinidad and Tobago on my mother's side; my father means absolutely nothing to me and is completely irrelevant to ANY conversation.  I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio my whole life, and I started visiting my home country in 2018.  I'm an adventurous person, and I can't sit in one place for long.  Going out with my husband is the highlight of my life currently (since I keep a very small circle).  I love animals, board and card games, as well as reading and learning new skills.</p>
